I develop things for myself and then make sure you can use them too.

Fan of [instantOS](https://instantos.io), [[matrix]](https://matrix.org), [Ada](https://www.adacore.com) (he says, developing in NodeJS anyways), [TitaniumNetwork](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev), but most importantly, [samy](https://github.com/samyk) is my hero

## work i'm proud of
